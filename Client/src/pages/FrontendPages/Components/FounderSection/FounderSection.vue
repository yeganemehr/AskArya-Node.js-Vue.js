        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Arya Doroudian. I was born and raised in London and moved to Iran last year to pursue my flying career as a commercial airline pilot. I am a native speaker of both English and Persian, as well as an intermediate French speaker.
          <br>
          <br>I graduated in BEng Computer Network Security from Westminster University, London. I then moved on to study for my Commercial Pilot Licence at Oxford Aviation Academy, London. I currently hold a Frozen Air Transport Pilot Licence (EASA), as well as a Commercial Pilot licence & Instrument Rating (ICAO).
          <br>
          <br>I have to say that one of my biggest passions is flying, which has enabled me to go to amazing and diverse places around the world.
